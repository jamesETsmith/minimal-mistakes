Many-body physics leveraging the tools of machine learning.

# Overview
(from https://www.netket.org/)

[NetKet](https://github.com/netket/netket) is an open-source project delivering cutting-edge methods for the study of many-body quantum systems with artificial neural networks and machine learning techniques.

# My Work
I helped implement graph-based hamiltonians and an interface with [PySCF](https://github.com/sunqm/pyscf).
For the release of version 2.0 I helped port the C++ to hybrid C++/Python and set up the testing suite using [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/).
In addition to helping with documentation and other less technical tasks I set up a binderhub so that users could try/test out NetKet from the web.
